Advanced Web Development Assignment(1&amp;2) - Library website using API's and Google Books. Uses Symfony.

Assignment Summary:
Symfony-based library website with book reviews, user accounts, and API features.
 - Core: User registration/login, CRUD for book reviews (title, author, pages, genre, summary, reviewer, review text).
 - Intermediate: Multiple users can review the same book.
 - Advanced: Roles (user/mod/admin), search, ratings, image uploads.
 - Assignment 2: RESTful API (JSON, CRUD for reviews, JWT auth), Google Books API integration via Guzzle, plus extra API features.

Contents Summary:
This repository only includes the PHP source files (src) and Twig templates (templates). These provide insight into the project’s structure and logic but do not contain everything required to run the full system.

Key configuration files (e.g. security.yaml), front-end assets (CSS/JS), and vendor/bundle code are excluded. This is intentional to prevent the project from being reused to directly complete the assignment — it is for demonstration/reference purposes only.
